inference with new dataset
inference speed/accuracy


------------------------------------
data augmentation

#  add other interesting augmentation as such that less keypoints are lost e.g. PerspectiveTransform
# or contrary hide keypoints (using masks of other images) in image data with object to make model more robust

#add a check if joints are outside the image, if so repeat augmentation
# add a filter if there is not enough joints present !!!!!!!!!!

add LSP dataset to LSPET

first train a model on the common joints and than finetune the final layer with the joints that are unique to
certain datasets

#for practical applications and the use of multiple dataset we only use 14 joints
#for now, it can be investigated that richer dataset can be used in such a way that for the
#datasets with less joints it is simply set to invisible

--------------------------------
evaluation

evaluate on random samples from all datasets
--------------------------------
refactor

save and load models

pose2keypoints code

keras to tf.keras

--------------------
reasearch

reduced architectures: mobilepose (resnet, mobilenetv2)

read hourglass paper

------------------------
CoreML

rewrite loss to work in 4 dimensions (concat stacks) --> also reduces batch footprint
