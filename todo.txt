data augmentation

#  add other interesting augmentation as such that less keypoints are lost e.g. PerspectiveTransform
# or contrary hide keypoints (using masks of other images) in image data with object to make model more robust

#add a check if joints are outside the image, if so repeat augmentation
# add a filter if there is not enough joints present

add LSP dataset to LSPET

--------------------------------
evaluation

evaluate on random samples from all datasets
--------------------------------
refactor

save and load models

pose2keypoints code

keras to tf.keras

--------------------
reasearch

reduced architectures: mobilepose (resnet, mobilenetv2)

read hourglass paper

------------------------
CoreML

rewrite loss to work in 4 dimensions (concat stacks) --> also reduces batch footprint
